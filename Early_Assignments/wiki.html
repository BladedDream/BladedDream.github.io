    <p><b>Cartoon Network</b> (often abbreviated as CN) is an American cable television channel owned by the Kids, Young Adults and Classics division of Warner Bros. Discovery Networks, itself a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery.
      Founded by Ted Turner (who appointed Betty Cohen as the first president of the network), the channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts animated television series, mostly children's programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It currently operates from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET/PT on weekdays, 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET/PT on Saturdays and from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET/PT on Sundays. Cartoon Network primarily targets children 6–14, while its early morning Cartoonito block is aimed at preschoolers and kindergarteners aged 2–6, and its overnight daypart block Adult Swim targets older teenagers and young adults, 18-34 (the latter is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a separate channel by Nielsen for ratings purposes).
      As of March 2021, Cartoon Network is available to approximately 94 million paid television households in the United States.</p>

    <p id='cartoon1'><b>Codename: Kids Next Door</b> (also known as Kids Next Door and KND) is an American animated television series created by Tom Warburton (credited as "Mr. Warburton") for Cartoon Network, and the 13th of the network's Cartoon Cartoons. The series follows the adventures of a diverse group of five 10-year-old children who operate from a high-tech treehouse, fighting against adult and teen villains with advanced 2×4 technology. Using their code names (Numbuhs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5),they are Sector V, part of a global organization called the Kids Next Door.
      The series' pilot premiered on Cartoon Network in mid-2001 as part of The Big Pick II, a special broadcast event showcasing 11 promising pilots for different series. The winner of a viewers' poll by Cartoon Network would decide which pilot would be greenlit by the network for a full series. After winning the poll, the series premiered on December 6, 2002, and ran until January 21, 2008, with six seasons and 78 episodes. Two television films were broadcast: Operation: Z.E.R.O., which aired in 2006, and Operation: I.N.T.E.R.V.I.E.W.S., which aired as the series finale in 2008.
      A special half-hour crossover episode with fellow Cartoon Network series, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, aired in 2007.
      Two video games, Operation S.O.D.A. and Operation V.I.D.E.O.G.A.M.E., were released based on the series. A handful of other Cartoon Network-branded games featuring the characters were also released. The series has also seen releases on DVD, both as part of Codename: Kids Next Door and as additions to other Cartoon Network compilation DVDs.</p>
